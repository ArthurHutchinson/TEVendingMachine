Code to Refactor:

-Should Items have a "location"?
-Should move output text to UserOutput
-Change AuditTracker methods to use actual amounts from other methods for all cases
-Fix/change output formatting for menus, displays, & audit file
-Could create a money super class and all types of money subclass from that (then refactor other code to use those)

Other notes:
-display should show "NO LONGER AVAILABLE" if quantity == 0
-make unit tests
